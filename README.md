# Human-Development-Index
Human Development Index prediction

In this analysis I predicted the human development index for Great Britain based on some assumptions of changes on the independent variables (GDP, GDP per capita,
Inflation, debt to GDP ration, Interest rate/ base rate, unemployment rate, average income tax, life expectancy and expected years of schooling).
